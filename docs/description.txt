Album Filter adds in-page text filtering to album pages on sites that lack a built-in album search.

First supported site (proof of concept): Facebook album pages.

Why it helps:
- Large album lists are hard to navigate
- Browser Find (Cmd/Ctrl + F) only works for content currently loaded
- Album Filter is built to make album discovery faster in long lists

Current scope:
- User-triggered filtering workflow in the browser
- Facebook support first, with room to add more supported sites over time

Album Filter is not affiliated with or endorsed by Meta/Facebook.
