Album Filter adds in-page text filtering for long, paginated album lists.

Why it helps:
- Large album lists are hard to navigate
- Browser Find (Cmd/Ctrl + F) only works for content currently loaded
- Album Filter is built to make album discovery faster in long lists

How it works:
- Click the extension icon to open/close the in-page Album Filter panel
- Type a query to filter loaded albums by title
- Click Auto-load to keep loading additional album batches, then Stop to stop
- Click Rescan loaded to re-read albums already present in the page DOM

Query behavior:
- Unquoted query: split into words, all words must appear in title (order-independent)
- Quoted query ("..." or '...'): exact phrase match in title

Product direction:
- Current support: Facebook album pages (first proof of concept target)
- Generic architecture for site-specific adapters
- Facebook support first, with room to add more supported sites over time
- User-triggered filtering workflow in the browser

There is currently no options page; behavior is controlled from the in-page panel.

Privacy:
- Album content is processed locally in your browser to provide filtering.
- No user data is transmitted to our servers.
- No user data is sold or shared with third parties.
