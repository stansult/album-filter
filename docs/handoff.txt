Project: album-filter (Chrome extension starter)

Goal of this handoff:
Provide a reusable extension scaffold that can be moved to a new repository and extended.

What is generic and ready:
- MV3 manifest + background service worker + popup + options + content stub.
- `chrome.storage.sync` preference wiring (`enabled`, `strictMode`).
- Packaging scripts in `package.json`.

Description workflow (Chrome Web Store):
- Source of truth: `docs/description.txt`.
- Packaging scripts compare `docs/description.txt` against `dist/.description-last`.
- If changed, packaging writes:
  - `dist/description-to-upload.txt`
  - `dist/.description-last`
- `description-to-upload.txt` is intentionally persistent so you can upload it manually.
- After uploading in CWS, you may delete `dist/description-to-upload.txt`.

Packaging commands:
- `npm run package`
  - Creates `dist/album-filter-<version>.zip`.
- `npm run package:patch`
  - Increments patch version in `manifest.json`, then packages.

Suggested next-thread priorities:
1. Replace `content.js` stub with real filtering logic.
2. Update manifest permissions/host access as needed.
3. Rewrite popup/options UI for product-specific workflows.
4. Keep `docs/description.txt` concise and non-keyword-stuffed for CWS policy compliance.

Workflow rules:
- Don't start implementing / changing code unless you got request from me, or you suggested changes and I told you to start
- Keep this handoff file updated whenever process changes so a fresh thread can resume without context loss.
- Before committing, review the full diff and draft a commit message that covers all included changes.
- Use default push target `origin/main` unless specified otherwise.
- Do not commit immediately after a reported fix until key regressions are rechecked.
- When labels/terminology change, keep docs in sync (at minimum `README.md` and `docs/description.txt`).
- Re-read edited files after changes to confirm final file content is correct.
